About
  Folders are very nice to have on action wheels, so I made a
  function to dynamically generate them, and for managing pages.

Usage
  The CustomActionWheelAPI automatically generates a main page,
  which is accessible with the following code:
-----
local actionWheel = require("action_wheel")
print(actionWheel.pages["main"])
-----
  To dynamically load and create folders, use the following code:
-----
local actionWheel = require("action_wheel")
--      "main" used as ex., anything works vvvv
actionWheel.loadFolders(actionWheel.pages["main"], {
    {<page id (string)>,<action wheel title>,<icon texture>,<icon uv x>,<icon uv y>,<icon width>,<icon height>}
})
-----
  Heres a personal example, taken directly from one of my files:
-----
local actionWheel = require("action_wheel")
actionWheel.loadFolders(actionWheel.pages["main"], {
    {"toggles","Toggles","textures.icon_main",0,0,16,16},
    {"funsies","Funsies","textures.icon_main",16,0,16,16},
    {"poses","Poses & Sits","textures.icon_main",32,0,32,32},
    {"accessories","Accessories & Clothes","textures.icon_main",0,16,32,32},
    {"expressions","Face Expressions","textures.icon_main",16,48,16,16},
    {"emotes","Emotes & Meme Animations","textures.icon_main",32,32,32,32}
})
