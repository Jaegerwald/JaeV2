Requirements
  The emote system requires "custom_functions" and
  "action_wheel". There needs to be a page present in
  "actionWheel.pages" called "emotes". This is where all the
  actions for emotes will go to. This page should be already
  there in "config.lua", generated by "actionWheel.loadFolders".

  -> Also Check "Animations.txt" for Animation setup!

Setting up an Emote Animation
  Emotes need Lua code keyframes in the animation to function
  properly. In the first frame of the emote, add a keyframe
  with the code "animations.model.start:play()", and at the
  last keyframe add the code "animations.model["end"]:play()".
  These animations are there to avoid visual glitches and to
  integrate the paper doll with the animations.

Adding emotes
  New emotes can be added through "emotes.load". Multiple calls
  of this function should work, although its recommended to only 
  use one in "config.lua". Here's how the function works:

  The function requires a table as an argument, structured like
  the following example:
-----
local emotes = require("emotes")
emotes.load({
                                    -- Animation
    {"Emote Name",{Icon UV X,Icon UV},"emote_name"}
})
-----

  Icons
    The emote icons are a size of 32x32 pixels.
    They're stored as a sprite sheet at `textures/icons/
    icon_emotes`. All you need to do to put the icon of the pose
    its defining at the X and Y of the top left corner of the icon.
    The sprite sheet itself should be able to be infinitely
    expanded.

  Animations
    The animations themselves need to be in "model.bbmodel",
    with a name of only characters and underscores. Anything
    else doesn't work for some reason.

Integrations with the expression system
  You might wanna swap the face during an emote. Luckily,
  there is a way without disrupting the normal expressions.
  Simply run the code "AnimFace(true)" as a Lua instruction
  keyframe at the start of your emote and "AnimFace(false)"
  at the end of your emote. Now you can run
  "SetFace("<Frame>","<Frame>")" in any Lua instruction key
  in the emote!
