Requirements
  The pose system requires "custom_functions" and "action_wheel".
  There needs to be a page present in "actionWheel.pages"
  called "poses". This is where all the actions for poses will
  go to. This page should be already there in "config.lua",
  generated by "actionWheel.loadFolders".

  -> Also Check "Animations.txt" for Animation setup!

Adding poses
  New poses can be added through "poses.load". Multiple calls
  of this function should work, its recommended to only use one call in "config.lua". Here's how the function works:

  The function requires a table as an argument, structured like
  the following example:
-----
local poses = require("poses")
poses.load({
                                    -- Animation
    {"Pose Name",{Icon UV X,Icon UV},"animation_name"}
})
-----

  Icons
    The pose icons need to be a size of 32x32 pixels.
    They're stored as a sprite sheet at "textures/icons/
    icon_poses.". All you need to do to put the icon of a pose
    its defining at the X and Y of the top left corner of the icon.
    The sprite sheet itself should be able to be infinitely
    expanded.

  Animations
    The animations themselves need to be in "model.bbmodel",
    with a name of only underscores and characters. Anything
    else doesn't work for some reason.

  That should be it! The rest should all work by itself.
